## ITM 352 Class

### Introduction

During the fall semester, I had the pleasure of taking my first class in the MIS major known as ITM352. This course delved into various aspects of web development, providing a comprehensive exploration of the tools and technologies essential for creating robust and dynamic web applications.

### Contributions and Achievements

Throughout the semester, I actively engaged in hands-on learning, tackling numerous labs and coding activities. These activities covered a spectrum of topics, from fundamental HTML and CSS concepts to more advanced JavaScript functionalities. Each task presented an opportunity to sharpen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of web development principles.

### Final Project: Building an E-Commerce Site

As the culmination of the semester's efforts, I successfully designed and implemented an e-commerce site for my final project. This comprehensive endeavor involved combining the skills acquired throughout the course and incorporating both front-end and back-end development techniques.

#### Project Highlights:

- **User Authentication:** Implemented a secure login and registration system.
- **Database Integration:** Utilized databases to store and manage product information and user data.
- **Dynamic Content:** Ensured a dynamic and responsive user interface for an enhanced user experience.
